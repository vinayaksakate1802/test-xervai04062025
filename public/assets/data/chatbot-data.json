AWS’s Lambda is a go-to for serverless computing.<br>5. Azure’s pricing can be friendlier for Windows-heavy setups.<br>6. AWS offers more global regions for low-latency needs.<br>7. Azure’s hybrid cloud game is strong with Azure Arc.<br>8. AWS’s S3 is a beast for storage flexibility.<br>9. Both support robust security, but Azure’s Defender integrates tightly with Microsoft.<br>10. XervAi masters both, so we’ll pick the best fit for your biz. Which one’s calling your name?"
